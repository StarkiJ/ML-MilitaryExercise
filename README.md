 Machine Learning: A military exercise

After the failed attempt to use reinforcement learning, this experiment was ultimately completed by writing an algorithm based on breadth-first search.

`DQNway.py` and `MEEnv.py` are failed attempts at machine learning. 

`find_path.py` is the code I wrote while trying to solve a pathfinding problem, which I treated as a draft.

The `data` folder contains the data used for the experiments:

`checker.exe` is a simple program that checks scores by `testcase*.out`.

For example:
```sh
checker.exe testcase1.in testcase1.out > report1.log
```

You can also directly show the log in the command prompt:
```sh
checker.exe testcase1.in testcase1.out
```
